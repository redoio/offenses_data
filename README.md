# Introduction
Data on the population currently incarcerated in any of the thirty-five state prisons under the jurisdiction of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) as of December 2023. Information was acquired via the California Public Records Act (CPRA). The Department applied several privacy (health information, age, etc.) related exclusionary criteria to release these records to Redo.io. Some identification numbers are hashed for de-identification as a result. 

Note: Data and analyses in this repository are fully independent of the Three Strikes Project, Stanford University and the Resentencing Data Initiative. This is an open data related effort not supported or related to any of the aforementioned parties.
