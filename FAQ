#### `Question` The structure of the CDCR ID is not recognizable to me. Why is that?
`Answer` The CDCR IDs are hashed using an md5 hash algorithm. In simple terms, though the prison sentences data is collected through the California Public Records Act (CPRA), we added an additional anonymization layer to protect incarcerated individuals' privacy. 
All individual names are hidden from public view. Additionally, their CDCR IDs are hashed, 
i.e. mapped to a new unique 10-character identifier that conceals the original value but remains consistent across all datasets: demographics, current commitments and prior commitments.

#### `Question` I found a compelling case but I cannot learn more about the individual using an anonymized CDCR ID. What should I do? 
`Answer` Please contact us with your request and we will be happy to provide you the individual's or cohort's original CDCR ID(s) and personal name(s) we have on file.

#### `Question` I noticed that some sentences are missing case numbers. Why are they not available? 
`Answer` Unfortunately, CDCR will not disclose certain information under the California Public Records Act (CPRA) despite our best efforts to collect full and complete information about prison sentences. 
We recognize that missing case numbers and CDCR IDs limits the use of our dataset. We are continuing to urge CDCR to provide more complete data to avoid these pitfalls. 
However, we hope that in instances wherein a case number for a controlling offense is missing, other information on their current and prior commitments may help identify the person in question. 
Please contact us with your inquiry and we will be happy to assist you further.

#### `Question` How do I cite the data and results? 
`Answer` Please reference our data, dashboards and analyses as follows: 

Redo.io [Computer software]. (2025). Retrieved from tool.redoio.info

#### `Question` How does this data differ from information acquired via a data sharing agreement? 
:green-badge[Answer] Our prison sentences data is a subset of the data that CDCR typically provides under a formal data sharing agreement between a county and the state. 
Formal data sharing agreements for prison sentences data typically include sex registration status, mental health level of care, CSRA scores, COMPAS scores, milestones achieved, education credits, gender etc. 
Though our CPRA requests to CDCR include all of the aforementioned variables (and more), CDCR states that they cannot disclose certain variables due to privacy restrictions in the law. 
For example, they stated that providing the gender and sex registration status of an individual would be a violation of the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA)

###### `Question` Has CDCR specified why certain variables cannot be disclosed under the CPRA? 
`Answer` CDCR refused to provide an explanation for omissions per variable. The Department provided a general explanation of the exclusionary criteria they applied:

The CA Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has partially denied your request because some of the identified records are exempt from disclosure. As such, the data elements requested have not been included in these data. The applicable exemptions are fully discussed below:
Code of Federal Regulations title 45, sections 160.103, 164.502(a), 164.508(a)(1), Government Code section 7927.705 Penal Code sections 11075, 11076, and 13102; Government Code section 7927.705 California Code of Regulations title 15, section 3261.2(e); Government Code section 7927.705 Government Code section 7927.70 Government Code section 7927.705; The Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), Code of Federal Regulations, Title 28, Part 115.41(i) requires agencies to implement appropriate controls on the dissemination of information related to a person’s gender identity to ensure that sensitive information is not exploited to the individual’s detriment.
Pursuant to Government Code sections 7927.705 and 7922.000, Penal Code 290.45, and WIC 827, these data exclude identifying information pertaining to offenders under the age of 18, where disclosure is prohibited by law, and those who CDCR has determined that the release of their information would create an unreasonable risk of danger to themselves.

###### `Question` My county has an existing data sharing agreement with the state. Can Redo.io help me analyze the datasets CDCR sends us? 
`Answer` Absolutely. We are happy to build custom solutions for your needs and use cases. Our public facing tool is meant to be a general purpose resource for an initial exploratory analysis. Please contact us with your request and we will be happy to support you.\

###### :blue-badge[Question] My county does not have an existing data sharing agreement with the state. But we have several data needs and questions. Can Redo.io support us in these efforts?
`Answer` Absolutely. If our existing tools and datasets are insufficient for your needs, we are happy to work with you to develop solutions that best fit your objectives. Please contact us with your request and we will be happy to support you.
